    <p>
      <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> (/ˈmjuːnɪk/ MEW-nik; German: München
      [ˈmʏnçn̩] is the capital and most populous city of <em>Bavaria</em>. With a
      population of 1,558,395 inhabitants as of July 31, 2020, it is the
      <em>third-largest city in Germany</em>, after Berlin and Hamburg, and thus
      the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the
      11th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is
      home to 6 million people. Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a
      tributary of the Danube) north of the Bavarian Alps, it is the seat of the
      Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most
      densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km2).
      <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> is the second-largest city in the
      Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of Vienna.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          When Bavaria was reunited in 1506,
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> became its capital. The arts and
          politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see Orlando di
          Lasso and Heinrich Schütz). During the 16th century,
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> was a centre of the German counter
          reformation, and also of renaissance arts. Duke Wilhelm V commissioned
          the Jesuit Michaelskirche, which became a centre for the
          counter-reformation, and also built the Hofbräuhaus for brewing brown
          beer in 1589. The Catholic League was founded in
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty
          Years' War, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> became an electoral
          residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the
          electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II
          Adolph of Sweden. When the bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635,
          about one-third of the population died. Under the regency of the
          Bavarian electors, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> was an important
          centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg
          occupations in 1704 and 1742. In 1806 the city became the capital of
          the new Kingdom of Bavaria, with the state's parliament (the Landtag)
          and the new archdiocese of <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> and
          Freising being located in the city. <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >'s annual Beer Festival, Oktoberfest, has its origins from a royal
          wedding in October 1810. The fields are now part of the
          'Theresienwiese' near downtown.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> lies on the elevated plains of Upper
          Bavaria, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps,
          at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL. The local rivers are the
          Isar and the Würm. <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> is situated in the
          Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau
          includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by
          the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is
          covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of
          fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate
          the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the
          north of <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >.

        <h2>Architecture</h2>
        <p>
          The city has an eclectic mix of historic and modern architecture,
          because historic buildings destroyed in World War II were
          reconstructed, and new landmarks were built. A survey by the Society's
          Centre for Sustainable Destinations for the National Geographic
          Traveller chose over 100 historic destinations around the world and
          ranked <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> 30th

          most successful club and a multiple UEFA Champions League winner.
          Other notable clubs include 1860 Munich, who were long time their
