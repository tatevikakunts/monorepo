    <h2 id="history">History</h2>
    <p>
      Dating all the way back to Stone Age Armenia is one of the oldest living
      civilizations in the world. During those long millennia Armenia lived
      through everything. From horrific crimes against humanities all the way to
      being one of the most powerful states of the time. Several 325,000
      year-old stone tools have been excavated from the Armenian Plateau. They
      prove that there have been civilization in this area at those times. In
      1960s archeologists found the remains of a hearth, human cranial fragment
      and a tooth from Yerevan 1 cave that were 48,000 years old. A very recent
      discovery of the earliest known leather shoe (3,500 BC, displayed in
      History Museum of Armenia), a straw skirt (3,900 BC) and wine-making
      facility (4,000 BC) in Areni-1 cave demonstrate leading development
      positions of locals during that era. Armenia is present on one of the
      oldest map found – Babylonian map of 500 BC. According to legend Armenian
      history begins when Hayk Nahapet kills King Bel with a three-headed arrow
      and frees his nation from tyranny, calling the country “Hayq” (Armenian –
      Հայք) and people “Hay” (Armenian – հայ). According to Bible, Gen. 8:4, the
      new civilization started when Noah’s Ark came to rest on a biblical
      mountain called Ararat, which from ancient Armenian literally means a
      place for creating. During the Bronze Age several states flourished in
      greater Armenia area (territory between Black, Caspian and Mediterranean
      seas also called Armenian Plateau). Some of the most influential states
      were Hittite Empire and Mitanni. Little later Nairi and the Kingdom of
      Urartu became ruling states in the region. King Sarduri 1st won the war
      with Assyrians making the Kingdom of Urartu the most powerful state in the
      Middle East with capital of Tushpa (modern Van). Armenia was at its peak
      during the reign of Tigran The Great. During the 40 years of his rule
      (95–55 BC) Armenian borders reached three seas – Caspian, Black and
      Mediterranean, hence the name From Sea to Sea Armenia. Many evidences
      state that Tigranian troops reached as far as China.

      In 301 Armenia became the first country in the world to adopt Christianity
      as state religion. Christianity played a huge role in Armenian history and
      culture. Ever since adoption of Christianity Armenians have shed a lot of
      blood to retain their religion and therefore identity. After adopting
      Christianity the need for recovering Armenian alphabet grew bigger and
      bigger. In 405 linguist and hymnologist Mesrop Mashtots went for a long
      trip to several countries to retrieve the Armenian alphabet. His retrieval
      was so complete that we use that same alphabet after more than 16
      centuries. In 1915 Armenia was part of Ottoman Empire. The despotic state
      had planned a massive cleansing of Armenians and other minorities in the
      Empire. On 24th of April 1915 more than 250 Armenian intellectuals and
      leaders have been arrested and deported from Constantinople (today’s
      Istanbul) and later killed by the state. The First World War created the
      perfect circumstances for Ottoman Empire to implement their horrifying
      plan. Some 1.5 mln Armenians have been tortured, starved, raped and
      marched to death. Thousands of Armenian churches and cultural monuments
      have been destroyed. Wounded Armenia tried hard to stand back up on its
      feet and created the first Armenian Republic on 28th of May 1918 with the
      capital of <a href="yerevan.html" target="_blank">Yerevan</a>. The first
      Republic of Armenia had 1.3 mln population and about 70,000 km2 area. The
      Soviet Era for Armenia started on 2nd December 1920. During the Soviet Era
      Armenia prospered once again, becoming the center of science and
      technology of USSR and creating the first computer of USSR in Mergelyan
      Center, Yerevan.

      Almost all domains of economy, education, politics and the overall quality
      of life in Armenia rose greatly. After the collapse of the USSR Armenia
      continued to develop independently. With one of a kind technological
      facilities in the region (EIF, GTC, TUMO, etc.) and big investments in
      tourism, agriculture and industry Armenia will live to see civilizations
      go by.
