        The first church in the world was built in Armenia
        <p>
          Holy Etchimiadzin was the first state church built in the world back
          in the early 4th century. This place is also the headquarter of all
          the churches in <a href="index.html">Armenia</a> and it’s one of the
          most visited pilgrimage site in the world. Unfortunately this
          beautiful building has been under construction for the past few years
          and we were unable to capture a nice shot of it.

        Armenia is one of the oldest wine producing country in the world
        <p>
          <a href="index.html">Armenia</a> is one of the oldest country that has
          produced wine in the world. It’s attributed to its blessed location of
          being on the fertile valleys of Mt Ararat where high quality grapes
          could be grown.

        The entire country worships Mt Ararat which is also the national symbol
        of Armenia
        <p>
          According to our guide, Mt Ararat protected
          <a href="index.html">Armenia</a> from a super strong earthquake! They
          also believe that the peak of Mt Ararat was where Noah’s ark was
          found. But sadly, Mt Ararat is not even within the territory of
          <a href="index.html">Armenia</a> at the moment.

          actually symbolises the apricot! That’s how significant apricots are
          to <a href="index.html">Armenia</a>! And when you walk through the
          markets, you’ll find vendors selling apricots of all sort from dried
          apricot, fresh apricot, apricot flavoured wine, apricot juice and
