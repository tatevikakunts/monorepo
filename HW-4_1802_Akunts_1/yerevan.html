      Blessed with ancient history and colorful culture, historical landmarks
      and natural attractions, unique architecture and masterpieces of Ancient
      era, add to this the eastern hospitality of the sophisticated friendly
      locals and the splendor of Armenian diverse culinary delights, Yerevan or
      the so-called ‘City of the Sun and Light’ is Armenia’s vibrant capital and
      the largest city, where past and present meet.

      Yerevan, also spelled Erevan, Erivan, or Jerevan, capital of
      <a href="index.html">Armenia</a>. It is situated on the Hrazdan River, 14
      miles (23 km) from the Turkish frontier. Though first historically
      recorded in 607 CE, Yerevan dates by archaeological evidence to a
      settlement on the site in the 6th–3rd millennia BCE and subsequently to
      the fortress of Yerbuni in 783 BCE. From the 6th century BCE it formed
      part of the Armenian kingdom. Modern Yerevan, which climbs the hillsides
      from the deep trench of the Hrazdan, is an attractive city in a fine
      natural setting framed by the extinct volcanic peaks of Mount Aragats and
      Mount Azhdaak to the north and Mount Ararat across the Turkish frontier to
      the south. Many modern buildings along its tree-lined streets have been
      constructed in traditional Armenian styles and of variously coloured local
      stone. Yerevan is a major cultural centre, with a university founded in
      1919 and many other institutions of higher education. The Armenian Academy
      of Sciences (est. 1943) is the most prominent of the many research
      institutions in the city. The Matenadaran archives (founded 1920) hold a
      rich collection of ancient Armenian manuscripts, such as the Lazarus
      Gospel of 887. Yerevan also has many theatres and museums.

    <h2 id="geography">Geography</h2>
    <p>
      Yerevan has an average height of 990 m (3,248.03 ft), with a minimum of
      865 m (2,837.93 ft) and a maximum of 1,390 m (4,560.37 ft) above sea level
      at the southwest and the northeast respectively. Worldwide it is among 50
      highest cities with over 1 million inhabitants. It is located on to the
      edge of the Hrazdan River, northeast of the Ararat plain (Ararat Valley),
      to the center-west of the country. The upper part of the city is
      surrounded with mountains on three sides while it descends to the banks of
      the river Hrazdan at the south. The Hrazdan divides Yerevan into two parts
      through a picturesque canyon. The city is situated at the heart of the
      Armenian Highland, in historic Kotayk canton (Armenian: Կոտայք գավառ
      Kotayk gavar, not to be confused with the current Kotayk Province) of
      Ayrarat province, within Armenia Major. In current administrative division
      of Armenia Yerevan is not part of any marz ("province"). Instead, it is
      bordered with the following provinces: Kotayk from the north and the east,
      Ararat from the south and the south-west, Armavir from the west and
      Aragatsotn from the north-west.

        Museums
        <p>
          Yerevan is home to a large number of museums, art galleries and

        Art
        <p>
          Yerevan is one of the historic centres of traditional Armenian carpet.
          Various rug fragments have been excavated in areas around Yerevan
          dating back to the 7th century BC or earlier. The tradition was
          further developed from the 16th century when Yerevan became the
          central city of Persian Armenia.

          However, carpet manufacturing in the city was greatly enriched with
          the flock of Western Armenian migrants from the Ottoman Empire
          throughout the 19th century, and the arrival of Armenian refugees
          escaping the genocide in the early 20th century. Currently, the city
          is home to the Arm Carpet factory opened in 1924, as well as the
          Tufenkian handmade carpets (since 1994), and Megerian handmade carpets
          (since 2000).

        Festivals
        <p>
          In addition to the art festivals, the city organizes many public
          celebrations that greatly attract the locals as well as the visitors.
          Vardavar is the most widely celebrated festival among Armenians,
          having it roots back to the pagan history of
          <a href="index.html">Armenia</a>. It is celebrated 98 days (14 weeks)
          after Easter. During the day of Vardavar, people from a wide array of
          ages are allowed to douse strangers with water. It is common to see
          people pouring buckets of water from balconies on unsuspecting people
          walking below them. The Swan Lake of the Yerevan Opera is the most
          popular venue for the Vardavar celebrations. In August 2015, Teryan
          Cultural Centre supported by the Yerevan Municipality has launched its
          1st Armenian traditional clothing festival known as the Yerevan Taraz
          Fest. As one of the ancient winemaking regions, many wine festivals
