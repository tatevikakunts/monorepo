      <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> (/ˈmjuːnɪk/ MEW-nik; German: München
      [ˈmʏnçn̩] is the capital and most populous city of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bavaria" target="_blank"
        ><em>Bavaria</em></a
      >
      . With a population of 1,558,395 inhabitants as of July 31, 2020, it is
      the <em>third-largest city in Germany</em>, after Berlin and Hamburg, and
      thus the largest which does not constitute its own state, as well as the
      11th-largest city in the European Union. The city's metropolitan region is
      home to 6 million people. Straddling the banks of the River Isar (a
      tributary of the Danube) north of the Bavarian Alps, it is the seat of the
      Bavarian administrative region of Upper Bavaria, while being the most
      densely populated municipality in Germany (4,500 people per km2).
      <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> is the second-largest city in the
      Bavarian dialect area, after the Austrian capital of
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vienna" target="_blank"

        <p>
          When Bavaria was reunited in 1506,
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> became its capital. The arts and
          politics became increasingly influenced by the court (see Orlando di
          Lasso and Heinrich Schütz). During the 16th century,
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> was a centre of the German counter
          reformation, and also of renaissance arts. Duke Wilhelm V commissioned
          the Jesuit Michaelskirche, which became a centre for the
          counter-reformation, and also built the Hofbräuhaus for brewing brown
          beer in 1589. The Catholic League was founded in
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> in 1609. In 1623, during the Thirty
          Years' War, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> became an electoral
          residence when Maximilian I, Duke of Bavaria was invested with the
          electoral dignity, but in 1632 the city was occupied by Gustav II
          Adolph of Sweden. When the bubonic plague broke out in 1634 and 1635,
          about one-third of the population died. Under the regency of the
          Bavarian electors, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> was an important
          centre of Baroque life, but also had to suffer under Habsburg
          occupations in 1704 and 1742. In 1806 the city became the capital of
          the new Kingdom of Bavaria, with the state's parliament (the Landtag)
          and the new archdiocese of <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> and
          Freising being located in the city. <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >'s annual Beer Festival,
          <a href="https://www.oktoberfest.de/" target="_blank"
            ><em>Oktoberfest</em></a
          >
          , has its origins from a royal wedding in October 1810. The fields are
          now part of the 'Theresienwiese' near downtown.

          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> lies on the elevated plains of Upper
          Bavaria, about 50 km (31 mi) north of the northern edge of the Alps,
          at an altitude of about 520 m (1,706 ft) ASL. The local rivers are the
          Isar and the Würm. <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> is situated in the
          Northern Alpine Foreland. The northern part of this sandy plateau
          includes a highly fertile flint area which is no longer affected by
          the folding processes found in the Alps, while the southern part is
          covered with morainic hills. Between these are fields of
          fluvio-glacial out-wash, such as around
          <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >. Wherever these deposits get thinner, the ground water can permeate
          the gravel surface and flood the area, leading to marshes as in the
          north of <strong><em>Munich</em></strong
          >.

          Being at the centre of Europe, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> is
          subject to many climatic influences, so that weather conditions there
          are more variable than in other European cities, especially those
          further west and south of the Alps. At Munich's official weather
          stations, the highest and lowest temperatures ever measured are 37.5
          °C (100 °F), on 27 July 1983 in Trudering-Riem, and −31.6 °C (−24.9
          °F), on 12 February 1929 in Botanic Garden of the city.

          Allianz Arena is a football stadium in Munich with a 70,000 seating
          capacity for international matches and 75,000 for domestic matches.
          Widely known for its exterior of inflated ETFE plastic panels, it is
          the first stadium in the world with a full colour changing exterior.
          Located at 25 Werner-Heisenberg-Allee at the northern edge of Munich's
          Schwabing-Freimann borough on the Fröttmaning Heath, it is the
          second-largest arena in Germany behind Westfalenstadion in Dortmund.

          From only 24,000 inhabitants in 1700, the city population doubled
          about every 30 years. It was 100,000 in 1852, 250,000 in 1883 and
          500,000 in 1901. Since then, Munich has become Germany's third-largest
          city. In 1933, 840,901 inhabitants were counted, and in 1957 over 1
          million. In July 2017, <strong><em>Munich</em></strong> had 1.42
          million inhabitants; 421,832 foreign nationals resided in the city as
          of 31 December 2017 with 50.7% of these residents being citizens of EU
          member states, and 25.2% citizens in European states not in the EU
